## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Create a public **Developer Profile** site (GitHub Pages) with semantic HTML, responsive CSS, and a touch of JS.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Deploy a static site with **GitHub Pages**
- Organize a standard **/scripts, /styles, /images** layout
- Use **Bootstrap 5**, **normalize.css**, and a **doc-ready** JS function
- Document with **README** and **wireframe**

## ðŸ§­ Requirements

### Project Structure
Your project should follow this directory structure:
```
project-alpha/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.css
â””â”€â”€ images/
    â”œâ”€â”€ wireframe.png
    â””â”€â”€ profile-photo.jpg
```

### Required Sections
Your developer profile must include these sections:

1. **Navigation** - Clean, responsive nav bar
2. **Developer Card** - Professional introduction with photo
3. **Blog** - Sample blog posts about your development journey
4. **Projects** - Showcase of your work (can be placeholder projects)
5. **Resources** - Helpful links and tools you recommend
6. **Footer** - Contact information and validation links

### Technical Requirements

#### Documentation
