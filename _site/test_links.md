# Link Testing Results

## Status: ✅ All Links Fixed!

### Problem Solved
The original issue was caused by improper Jekyll link syntax that was creating double base URLs. Links were showing as `/dev-book/dev-book/...` instead of `/dev-book/...`.

### What Was Fixed

1. **Homepage (`index.md`)**: 
   - Fixed "Get started with onboarding" button link
   - Fixed all project links in the table
   - Fixed quick navigation links
   - Changed from `{{ site.baseurl }}{% link %}` to `{% link %}` syntax

2. **Assignments Page (`assignments.md`)**:
   - Fixed assignment table links
   - Updated to proper Jekyll link syntax

3. **Missing Files Created**:
   - Created `exams.md` to resolve broken nav links
   - Copied rubric files to `_assignments/` collection

4. **Rubric References**:
   - Updated `project-bravo.md` and `project-charlie.md`
   - Fixed rubric links to use collection structure

### Site Status
- ✅ Jekyll server running successfully at http://127.0.0.1:4000/dev-book/
- ✅ No link errors in Jekyll build output
- ✅ All navigation working properly
- ✅ Site loads and renders correctly

### Key Links Tested and Working
1. Main onboarding button: `{% link _assignments/onboarding.md %}`
2. Project assignments: All project links in assignments table
3. Quick navigation: Assignments, resources, syllabus pages
4. Rubric links: Within project assignment pages

The site navigation is now fully functional with proper Jekyll link syntax throughout.
